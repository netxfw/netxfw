                              WHY DUAL LICENSE?
================================================================================

The BPF code uses GPL-only kernel helper functions (e.g., bpf_ktime_get_ns,
bpf_tail_call, bpf_redirect_map) which require GPL-compatible licensing for
kernel loading. The dual license provides:

1. GPL-2.0-only: Required for kernel compatibility with GPL-only helpers
2. BSD-2-Clause: More permissive option for users who don't need GPL-only helpers

When the BPF program is loaded into the Linux kernel, the kernel will check
the license string. The "Dual BSD/GPL" license string in the BPF code allows
the kernel to recognize it as GPL-compatible.
