                              LICENSE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

This project uses a dual-license structure:

1. Go User-Space Code (Apache-2.0)
   --------------------------------
   Files: internal/*, cmd/*, pkg/*, test/*
   License: Apache License, Version 2.0
   See: LICENSE file

   This includes patent protection and is suitable for commercial use.

2. BPF Kernel Code (Dual BSD/GPL)
   -------------------------------
   Files: bpf/*
   License: BSD-2-Clause OR GPL-2.0-only (your choice)

   The dual license provides flexibility:
   - BSD-2-Clause: More permissive, commercial-friendly
   - GPL-2.0-only: Required for kernel compatibility with GPL-only helpers

   GPL-only helper functions used:
   - bpf_ktime_get_ns (time tracking)
